\section{Introduction}

% There are a few different strategies we can go with here. We could attack the beyond being there problem, and go for the "thinking about face to face" bit. Alternatively, a more general plea for shifting attention back to synchronicity - asynchronous has its issues, and we still (rightfully) privilege real time encounters. The motivating metaphor here being the weirdly object-centric models of asychronous encounters, not people-centric models.

% Some other related themes:
% - channels
% - attention
% - text v audio
% - power relationships / confidence?
% - ???

% The core question is what do my systems encompass and lend themselves more to. Clearly they're all synchronous experiences, not async. So that's fine.
